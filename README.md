# PacMen-Factory
In this project you can create pacmen and simulate their movement. Have fun!

## Quick Start Guide
Start by clicking the **Create 1 PacMan** button as many times as you like. Please note that the more pacmen there are, the slower it will run. Click **Start Game** to start the simulation.

## Tips
- If the simulation slows down too much, click the **Clear Pacmen** button or click any of the **Remove x PacMen** buttons.
- You can pause the game once it starts using the **Pause Game** button which replaces the **Start Game** button if the game is running.
